        <h2>Why Did I Choose Web Development?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            I have been a career software developer for nearly twenty-five years but I always had this nagging feeling that there were very important skills missing from my toolbox.
            About twenty years ago, I had an opportunity to learn these skills but I was intimidated by the prospect of doing so.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Hunter Business School&apos;s Web Application Design and Development (WADD) program is top-notch--the various tools and methodologies I have learned are invaluable additions to the programming skills I already possess.</p>
